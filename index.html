                <p class="italic">Hello! My name is Kate Efone. I am a banker working as a Relationship Manager.
                    I enjoy providing excellent service, financial advice and smart investment plans to people which will aid in achieving their financial goals. 
                    Beyond the office, I'm passionate about diving into the tech space, starting with Frontend development as a solid foundation, 
                    gradually progressing to become a well rounded full stack developer. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="italic">My interested in web development sparked late last year, and I took the initiative to learn the basics from Youtube tutorials. 
                    I am currently learning Frontend at Career Ex. My goal is to fully transition into the world of
                    software engineering and work on live projects that solve real-world problems and drive innovation.
                    I strongly believe in continuous learning and development - always striving to grow, improve, and stay relevant in an ever-evolving world
                </p>
